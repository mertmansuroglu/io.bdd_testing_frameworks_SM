# Test Automation Framework

In this framework, API test-automation, UI test-automation, and Mobile test-automation are combined into one, unified framework. It is based on many steps (key-words).Therefore, It is possible to create test cases using these steps even if you don't know how to code

#### Steps

<a name='step1'></a>
##### 1- Defining api request
To define a new api request you can use following step

```* Define new request```
For a check on the implementation of defining a new request step, please visit [RequestImp](https://github.com/vmso/io.bdd_testing_frameworks/blob/bf4efcca584de9cfeeea06e5cd22863bdc6b3afa/mutual_methods/src/main/java/imp/RequestImp.java#L1) class.
